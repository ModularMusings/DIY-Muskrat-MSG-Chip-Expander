# What is this?
For owners of both the Muskrat and the (5) expansion chips, you've no doubt found the process of switching the chips a bit of a a hassle; remove module, pop out and swap IC, reinstall module.

I thought about a solution for this and after a few emails with Ross over at Moffenzeef I landed on this design. A simple PCB Panel which puts the main IC on the front and a cable around the back connecting to the Muskrat. Now you can easily swap ICs without opening your case!

# What you need
You need a couple components, a printed PCB and about 15 minutes to solder it up. If soldering is not your bag email me and I could (for a small fee) send you a completed build.

# BOM
For parts you only need a few components. I've listed them below.

# PCB
The Gerber file is included in this repo, just upload the ZIP file to your PCB printer of choice and viola! I personally use https://jlcpcb.com and so far they've been great.
